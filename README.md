# Overview

This repository contains statistical analyses exploring relationships between key student-level and school-level factors and education outcomes. Using Python-based statistical tools, we apply hypothesis testing and regression techniques to uncover meaningful patterns in academic performance, discipline, and graduation rates.

These analyses support data-driven decision-making in education policy, equity strategies, and program design.

## Key Analyses

### Graduation Rate Predictors

Technique: Linear regression
Description:
Explores how variables such as chronic absenteeism, ELA/Math proficiency, school size, and free/reduced lunch status predict on-time graduation.

### Suspension Rate Disparities

Technique: Two-sample t-tests, ANOVA
Description:
Tests for statistically significant differences in suspension rates by race/ethnicity, gender, and school type.
